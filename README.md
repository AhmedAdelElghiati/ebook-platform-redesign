# Project Overview: Ebook Platform Improvement

## 1. Executive Summary
 This project aims to improve an existing Ebook platform by fixing usability and system integration problems.  The main focus is to make the platform easier to use, more secure, and to provide a smooth user journey from choosing a book to downloading it.

## 2. Problem Statement
 Users face multiple problems while using the platform, such as difficulty accessing their accounts and completing payments.  These issues are caused by poor UI/UX design and a lack of system integration.

### 2.1 The Core Issue: Lack of System Integration
 The main issue is that the platform systems are not connected.  Login, payment, and download work as separate parts instead of one complete system.

## 3. Detailed Analysis of Identified Problems

The following specific issues have been identified as major barriers to user satisfaction:

| Issue Category | Description | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Security Risks** |  The platform uses one general password. |  This is unsafe and makes user accounts vulnerable to security risks. |
| **Misleading Feedback** |  The system does not give clear messages to users when an error happens. |  This makes it hard to know what went wrong. |
| **Poor Layout** |  The interface is crowded and not well-organized. |  This affects readability and user focus. |
| **Poor Affordance** |  Buttons and interface elements are not clearly recognizable. |  Users are not sure what actions they can take. |
| **Fragmented Payment** |  The payment process is broken into many steps across different pages and tabs. |  This increases user effort and confusion. |
